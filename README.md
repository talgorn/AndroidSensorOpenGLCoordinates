# AndroidSensorOpenGLCoordinates
A visual tool to help understand the relation between Android sensors and OpenGL coordinate system.
HOW TO USE IT:
1. Put your cellphone flat, facing north.
2. Sensor coordinates on top will display roughly 0,0,0 (Radians)
3. Start to move gently the device:
    * Android sensor values (radians) are visible on the top bar
    * The 3D colored arrow represents the default OpenGL cooordinates system:
    * Red Green Blue = X Y Z
4. After some minutes, take an aspirin :)
